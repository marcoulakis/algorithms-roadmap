# Algorithms Roadmap
This is supposed to be a little roadmap about what topics are great to study for big tech job interviews and programming competitions. Hope you enjoy :)
> [!NOTE]  
> This content is intended to be studied linearly, section by section. Therefore, it is recommended to engage with the Data Structure topic concurrently with the study of Algorithms, progressing through the subtopics in sequential order. The arrangement of topics has been structured from the most important and fundamental to the most challenging and supplementary concepts.
## Study 
### Data Structure
 1. [Arrays](https://www.educative.io/answers/what-are-arrays-in-python)
 2. [Dictionaries](https://www.educative.io/answers/what-are-python-dictionaries)
 3. [Objects and Classes](https://www.educative.io/answers/what-is-objectoriented-programming)
 4. [Linked List](https://www.educative.io/answers/what-is-a-linked-list)
 5. [Stacks](https://www.educative.io/answers/what-is-a-stack)
 6. [Queues](https://www.educative.io/answers/what-is-a-queue)
 8. [Trees](https://www.educative.io/answers/what-is-a-tree)
 9. [Hashing](https://www.educative.io/answers/what-is-hashing) (this is hard, it is not required to get deep)
 10. [Graphs](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/graph-data-structure-and-algorithms/) (not so necessary, but it great to know about)
### Algorithms
 1. [Asymptotic general notations](https://www.educative.io/answers/what-is-big-o-notation)
 2. [Big O notation](https://www.educative.io/answers/what-is-big-o-notation)
 3. [Time Complexity](https://www.educative.io/answers/what-is-the-time-complexity-of-an-algorithm)
 4. [Time vs. Space Complexity](https://www.educative.io/answers/time-complexity-vs-space-complexity)
 5. [Asynchronous vs synchronous programming](https://www.mendix.com/blog/asynchronous-vs-synchronous-programming/)
 6. [Recursion](https://www.educative.io/answers/what-is-recursion)
 7. [Scalability](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-scalability-and-how-to-achieve-it-learn-system-design/) (not required to get deep, just understand the concept)
 8. [Searching algorithms](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/searching-algorithms/) (not required to memorize or get deep, just understand as a case study)
 9. [Sorting algorithms](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sorting-algorithms/) (not required to memorize or get deep, just understand as a case study)
 10. [Dynamic Programming](https://www.educative.io/answers/what-is-dynamic-programming) (not required to get deep, just understand the concept)
